# Windows Mouse Jiggler - Security Friendly

A lightweight, security-conscious mouse jiggler for Windows that prevents system sleep and screensaver activation without triggering security warnings.

## ðŸŽ‰ Version 1.1 - System Tray Edition

**NEW:** System tray integration! Run headless with convenient right-click menu controls.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Security Friendly**: Uses minimal, transparent mouse movements
- **System Tray Integration**: Runs in background with visual status indicators
- **Right-Click Menu**: Easy access to start/stop and configuration
- **Configurable**: Adjustable intervals and movement distance
- **Safe**: Uses PyAutoGUI library (well-established and trusted)
- **Standalone Executable**: No Python installation required
- **Minimal Impact**: Very small movements (1-2 pixels by default)

### Version Comparison

| Feature    | v1.0 Console   | v1.1 System Tray             |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Interface  | Command line   | System tray                  |
| Background | Manual         | Automatic                    |
| Controls   | Text commands  | Right-click menu             |
| Status     | Console output | Visual icons + notifications |
| Deployment | Multiple files | Single executable            |

## Why This Approach is Security Friendly

1. **Transparent Operation**: Uses standard PyAutoGUI library, not low-level injection
2. **Minimal Movements**: Tiny 1-2 pixel movements that barely affect cursor position
3. **User Control**: Clear start/stop commands and visual feedback
4. **No Hidden Behavior**: All actions are logged to console
5. **Standard Library**: Uses well-known, legitimate automation library

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed
2. Run the batch file or install manually:

### Option 1: Use the batch file

```batch
run_jiggler.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python mouse_jiggler.py
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Run `python mouse_jiggler.py`
2. Type `start` to begin
3. Type `stop` to pause
4. Type `quit` to exit

### Commands

- `start` - Start the mouse jiggler
- `stop` - Stop the mouse jiggler
- `interval X` - Set interval to X seconds (minimum 5)
- `distance X` - Set movement distance to X pixels (1-10)
- `status` - Show current status
- `help` - Show help information
- `quit` or `exit` - Exit the program

### Example Session

```
> interval 30        # Jiggle every 30 seconds
> distance 1         # Move 1 pixel
> start              # Begin jiggling
[14:30:15] Mouse jiggled - keeping system active
[14:30:45] Mouse jiggled - keeping system active
> stop               # Stop jiggling
> quit               # Exit
```

## Configuration Options

### Interval Settings

- **Default**: 60 seconds
- **Minimum**: 5 seconds
- **Recommended**: 30-120 seconds
- **Purpose**: How often to perform the jiggle

### Movement Distance

- **Default**: 1 pixel
- **Range**: 1-10 pixels
- **Recommended**: 1-2 pixels
- **Purpose**: How far to move the mouse

## Security Considerations

### Why This Won't Trigger Windows Security

1. **No DLL Injection**: Doesn't inject code into other processes
2. **No Low-Level Hooks**: Doesn't install global mouse hooks
3. **Standard API Usage**: Uses standard Windows mouse APIs through Python
4. **Transparent Process**: Runs as a normal user application
5. **No System Modification**: Doesn't modify system files or registry

### Antivirus Considerations

- Uses PyAutoGUI, a legitimate automation library
- No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns
- Open source and auditable
- Minimal system interaction
- Clear logging of all actions

### Corporate Environment Friendly

- No admin privileges required
- Doesn't bypass security policies
- Transparent operation with logging
- Can be easily monitored or disabled
- Uses standard automation approaches

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. Gets current mouse position
2. Moves mouse 1-2 pixels right
3. Immediately moves back to original position
4. Waits for specified interval
5. Repeats

### Why This Prevents Sleep

- Windows monitors for user input activity
- Mouse movement counts as user activity
- Prevents system sleep and screensaver
- Keeps applications active

### Performance Impact

- Minimal CPU usage (mostly sleeping)
- No memory leaks (Python garbage collection)
- Small memory footprint
- No impact on system performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ImportError: No module named 'pyautogui'**

   - Solution: Run `pip install pyautogui`

2. **Permission denied**

   - Solution: Run from a location you have write access to

3. **Mouse not moving**

   - Check if interval is too long
   - Verify pyautogui is working: `python -c "import pyautogui; print(pyautogui.position())"`

4. **Still going to sleep**
   - Decrease interval (try 30 seconds)
   - Increase movement distance (try 2-3 pixels)

### Known Limitations

- Requires Python to be installed
- Doesn't work if Python process is suspended
- Mouse movements may be visible (by design for transparency)
- Failsafe: Move mouse to top-left corner to stop PyAutoGUI
